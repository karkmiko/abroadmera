    <p>With AI growing smarter each year, the question is no longer if technology will influence education — but how deeply it already has.</p>
    <p>From AI tutors to personalized learning paths, education is transforming. While some fear machines will replace teachers, most experts see AI as a powerful support tool.</p>
    <p>But challenges remain: How do we ensure equal access to these tools? How do we balance data and privacy? And most importantly, how do we keep human connection at the heart of learning?</p>
    <p>The future classroom may look different, but its goal — to empower minds — will always stay the same.</p>
